# Yogi — Findings (empirical, append-only)

Live results from **foreground** runs (operator-initiated; the automated loop never runs the model).

## 2026-06-21 — first live end-to-end verification (qwen3:8b, 16 GB Mac)

- **Stack:** M0–M5 run live on `qwen3:8b`, foreground, machine stable, no crash. Single inference
  answered correctly in 22 s (incl. ~5 GB cold load).
- **Determinism:** added `temperature` to the proposer (default **0.0 / greedy**) after observing the
  same suite score 0.9 then 1.0 across two runs — sampling noise was swamping the signal. With temp 0
  the bench measures capability, not randomness.
- **Calibrated bench:** the easy 5-task tier saturates at 1.0 cold (no headroom), so a 5-task harder
  tier was added. Deterministic Day-0 cold = **0.900** (the model fails one task cold — e.g.
  `anagram` / `prime-7th`).
- **Compounding (Day-0 vs Day-N):** `Day-0 0.900 → Day-N 1.000`, paired delta **+0.100**,
  CI **[0.000, 0.300]**, `compounds=false`.
  - The **memory mechanism measurably works**: Day-N fixed the cold-failed task by semantically
    retrieving the studied answer into context (token-space compounding, D-M3-1).
  - The **falsification gate correctly does NOT certify it** at N=10 (a single-task gain → bootstrap
    CI includes 0). Conservative-by-design; it won't over-claim.
- **Self-modification:** on a no-improvement run the Two-Gate **rejected every candidate edit
  (rollback)** — live verification it refuses noise-level gains.

### What this validates
- The being **compounds directionally via token-space memory**, live and end-to-end.
- The anti-theater / compounding gate is **appropriately conservative** (real mechanism, no
  over-claim).
- The Two-Gate self-modification **refuses noise** and rolls back, as designed.

### Next — to actually FIRE the compounding gate (not just show direction)
A larger, harder, provenance-isolated corpus the model reliably fails cold on a meaningful fraction,
sized with enough tasks + replications to beat run-to-run variance (the derived replication count of
build-spec §7). This is corpus-curation + foreground-run work, not loop-buildable; it's the concrete
next step toward un-suspending the metabolism/evolution language and opening the M6 gate.
